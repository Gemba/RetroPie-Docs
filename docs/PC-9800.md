## Emulator: [lr-np2kai](https://github.com/AZO234/NP2kai)
This emulator can be installed from the experimental menu of the [RetroPie-Setup script.](Updating-RetroPie#using-the-retropie-setup-script)

Libreto Docs for Neko Project II Kai are [HERE](https://docs.libretro.com/library/neko_project_ii_kai/)

## ROMS

Accepted File Extensions: **.d88 .d98 .88d .98d .fdi .xdf .hdm .dup .2hd .tfd .hdi .thd .nhd .hdd .fdd .cmd .hdn .zip** 

Place your PC-98 games in:
```
/home/pi/RetroPie/roms/pc98
```

## Multi Disk Games

Many PC-98 games can be played as Hard Drive installs (`.hdi`), but many games are run from multiple floppies. To load two disks simultaneously into the emulator, you need to use a `.cmd` file, rather than a `.m3u` file.   
For example, _Story of Melroon_ has a Disk A and Disk B, so create a file named _The Story of Melroon.cmd_ containing:

```
np2kai "The Story of Melroon (Disk A).nfd" "The Story of Melroon (Disk B).nfd"
```
Starting the game from the `.cmd` file will load the _Disk A_ into the _FDD1_ disk drive and _Disk B_ into the _FDD2_ drive. Changing the disk in _FDD2_ can be done through RetroArch's disk control menus. The core will swap the contents of the _FDD2_ drive by default when using the disk control menus, to swap the disk in _FDD1_ there a core option which needs to be changed (_'Swap Disks on Drive'_).

Some floppy disk images need to be writeable, as save data needs to be written to it. If they're not alreay writeable, run from the terminal the following command to change them is:

``` sh
chmod u+w /path/to/your/disk_image_file
```


For example, based on the game mentioned before, changing the save disk's image file to be writeable would be:
``` sh
chmod u+w "$HOME/RetroPie/roms/pc98/The Story of Melroon (Disk B).nfd"
```

## Controls

lr-np2kai utilise Retroarch configurations

Add custom retroarch controls to the retroarch.cfg file in
```shell
/opt/retropie/configs/pc98/retroarch.cfg
```
For more information on custom RetroArch controls see: [RetroArch Configuration](RetroArch-Configuration)

## Performance Tweaks

The "CPU Clock Multiplier" option in the RetroArch options menu is fairly important when it comes to performance.  Setting it too low might cause your game to run slower than intended, but setting it too high can cause stuttering and slow performance.  It is recommended to use somewhere between a 4x and 8x multiplier.
