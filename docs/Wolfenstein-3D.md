***

_Wolfenstein 3D is a first-person shooter video game developed by id Software and published by Apogee Software in 1992 for the PC operating system DOS._

***

## Port: [Wolf4SDL](https://github.com/mozzwald/wolf4sdl)

Wolf4SDL can be installed from the optional menu of the RetroPie setup script. By default, the shareware version 1.4 of Wolfenstein 3D will be installed, but if the proper `.wl6` files from the commercial version are copied beforehand, the installation will add launch entries for the full version. Check the next section for which files from the commercial version are needed where they can be acquired.

After the installation, EmulationStation should be restarted for the new Wolfenstein game(s) entries to show up under the _Ports_ system. 

The following games are supported:

 - Wolfenstein 3D and it's Demo
 - Wolfenstein 3D - Spear of Destiny, episodes 1 to 3 and it's Demo

## Playing the full version

To play the full version of Wolfenstein 3D with Wolf4SDL, you need to provide your own game data which can purchased from [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/2270), [GOG.com](https://www.gog.com/game/wolfenstein_3d_and_spear_of_destiny) or [3D Realms](https://3drealms.com/catalog/wolfenstein-3d_25/).

The game data required are the files with `*.wl6` extension (see below for list). Place them in 

```
 /home/pi/RetroPie/roms/ports/wolf3d
```

then install (or re-install, if you already did an installation) the `wolf4sdl` port from RetroPie-Setup.

## Troubleshooting

If you are getting NO WOLFENSTEIN 3-D DATA FILES to be found! or NUMCHUNKS errors or you are not sure which version of game data you have, then check your game data by finding the md5 checksums. To do this, once you have placed your game data in the rom folder and made sure the file names are lower case, run the following commands:

	cd RetroPie/roms/ports/wolf3d
	md5sum *.wl6

The md5 checksums for supported game data are as follow:

Check also that you have all of the files above.

N.B. If your Spear of Destiny installation is missing the `.sd1` files, rename the following files to ensure that Episode 1 will launch correctly:

	gamemaps.sod -> gamemaps.sd1
	maphead.sod -> maphead.sd1
	vswap.sod -> vswap.sd1

If you have game data files that do not match the MD5 sums above, but are still valid, then please post the files and their checksums over at the [RetroPie Forum](https://retropie.org.uk/forum).
